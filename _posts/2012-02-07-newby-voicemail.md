## internet notoriety

### Tuesday, February 07, 2012 » [voicemail](/tags/voicemail/)

My second day at my last job I showed up early.  I came in the unlocked doors and I set off an insane alarm.  Strobe lights were in effect.  I left a voicemail for my boss that has become something of urban legend.  One of my coworkers posted it on his [blog](http://www.caffeinatedcoder.com/new-employee-hall-of-fame/) and it got picked up by someone who blogs regularly at Microsoft.  It was associated with another urban legend story at MS about a new employee dinging the car of someone with the lastname Gates.

I find the whole thing funny.  It is part of my history now.  Someday I may own up my second 'Internet Notorious' moment.
