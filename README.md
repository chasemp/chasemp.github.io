# chasemp.github.io

**Status:** Archive / Blog Legacy

This repository previously hosted both a Jekyll blog and the timeline.523.life application.

## Current Status

**Timeline Site:** Moved to dedicated repository
- Repository: https://github.com/chasemp/timeline
- Live Site: https://timeline.523.life

**This Repo:** Contains archived blog artifacts and legacy content
- Old blog index (index.html)
- Legacy directories (Alf/)
- May be repurposed for future blog content

## Migration

The timeline site was migrated on **October 15, 2025** to resolve GitHub Pages caching issues with namesake repositories.

### What Was Migrated

The following were moved to the [timeline repository](https://github.com/chasemp/timeline):
- Complete Astro application (timeline.523.life site)
- Blog posts (_posts/ directory - 36 markdown files)
- Assets (images, PDFs, audio files)
- GitHub Actions workflow (automated data fetching)
- Deployment scripts
- Documentation

### Why the Migration

GitHub Pages on namesake repositories (username.github.io) have unique caching behavior that was causing persistent cache issues. Moving to a dedicated repository provides:
- Independent deployment pipeline
- Better cache control
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Isolated troubleshooting
