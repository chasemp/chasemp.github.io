I enjoy translating What We Are Trying To Achieve into How Are We Going To Achieve It when it comes to implementing and scaling technical infrastructure, building tooling to improve developer experience, and refining real world digital use cases with security of assets as a first class citizen.

I strive to be pragmatic in a manner informed by my earnest desire to build solutions I am content to live with myself.

I am a policy and process nerd who believes navigating the corridors of too much or too little is an expected constant over the evolution of a team and organization.

I embrace GRC as a means to an end, automation as a way of life, deep bites into nuanced scaling issues as key forks in the road, and change as the only constant.
